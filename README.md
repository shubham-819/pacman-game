# BFS-based-pacman

In this project to have a better insight of usage and applicability of graph algorithms I tried to develop a small Pacman like game using vanilla JavaScript and DOM (Document Object Model) where the ghost always takes the shortest path to chase down our Pacman. 


## Setting up
```
npm install
npx parcel index.html
```
